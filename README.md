## Abstract
This work introduces **Simulated Over-parameterization Direction (SOD)**, a deterministic framework designed to escape spurious local minima in non-convex matrix sensing. By simulating the landscape of an over-parameterized space through a "lifting" mechanism, we provide provable guarantees for reaching the global optimum without relying on random noise.
